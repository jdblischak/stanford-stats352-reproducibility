# Examples of reproducible workflows for Standard STATS 352

* `spotify.csv` - Spotify data created by
[`spotify_dataset.R`](https://github.com/walkerkq/spotify_genre_classification/blob/master/spotify_dataset.R)
written by [kaylin Pavlik](https://www.kaylinpavlik.com)

* `spotify.Rmd` - Analysis of Spotify song genres inspired by the blog post
[Understanding + classifying genres using Spotify audio
features](https://www.kaylinpavlik.com/classifying-songs-genres/) written by
[kaylin Pavlik](https://www.kaylinpavlik.com). I purposefully added errors to
demonstrate common reproducibility problems.

* `workflowr/` - the spotify analysis converted to a workflowr project
